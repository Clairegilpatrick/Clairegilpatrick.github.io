<p> I was born in Houlton, Maine and moved to San Diego, California when I was two.
<P>I have lived in three different cities all over the country.</P>
<p>I went to Houlton High School and graduated in the class of 2018 with 83 students in my class. </p>
<p> In my free time I sing and play my guitar.</p>
<p> I also enjoy watching The Office and being around the people that are important to me. </p>

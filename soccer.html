<p> I started playing soccer when I was three years old.</p>
<p> I've played for numerous club and intermeral teams. </p>
<p> My senior year we won states in Class C for soccer! </p>
<P> Winning States was such an amazing experience because all the years of
    hard work and dedication to the sport I love finally paid off! </P>
